            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of dr. Pavlov's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>14 September 1849</strong> - born in Ryazan, Russian Empire</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1860</strong> - the son of a priest, he attended a church school and theological seminary.
                    However, he was inspired by the ideas of Charles Darwin and I.M. Sechenov, the father of Russian
                    physiology, and gave up his theological studies in favor of scientific pursuit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1870</strong> - he enrolled in the physics and mathematics faculty to take the course in
                    natural science.


                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1875</strong> - Pavlov completed his course with an outstanding record and received the
                    degree of Candidate of Natural Sciences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1879</strong> - however, impelled by his overwhelming interest in physiology, he decided to
                    continue his studies and proceeded to the Academy of Medical Surgery to take the third course there.
                    He had completed this and was again awarded a gold medal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1890</strong> - Ivan Petrovich was invited to organize and direct the Department of
                    Physiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. Under his direction, which continued over a
                    period of 45 years to the end of his life, this Institute became one of the most important centres
                    of physiological research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1890</strong> - he was appointed Professor of Pharmacology at the Military Medical Academy
                    and five years later he was appointed to the then vacant Chair of Physiology, which he held till
                    1925.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1903</strong> - at the 14th International Medical Congress in Madrid, Pavlov read a paper on
                    «The Experimental Psychology and Psychopathology of Animals». In this paper the definition of
                    conditioned and other reflexes was given and it was shown that a conditioned reflex should be
                    regarded as an elementary psychological phenomenon, which at the same time is a physiological one.
                    It followed from this that the conditioned reflex was a clue to the mechanism of the most highly
                    developed forms of reaction in animals and humans to their environment and it made an objective
                    study of their psychic activity possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1901</strong> - was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

                    <strong>1904</strong> - awarded a Nobel Prize.
